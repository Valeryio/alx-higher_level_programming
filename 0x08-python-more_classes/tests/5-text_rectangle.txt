==================================================
	How to use the module 5-rectangle.py?
==================================================

This module is pretty simple since it only has one class with its
properties and methods. This is the class ``rectangle``!

Importing dynamically the module
::
	>>> Rectangle = __import__('5-rectangle').Rectangle


Implementation of the __del__ method
=====================================
Testing the __del__ of the class
::
	>>> a = Rectangle(2, 4)
	>>> del a
	Bye rectangle...
