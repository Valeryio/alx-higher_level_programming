	How to use the module 6-rectangle.py?
==================================================

This module is pretty simple since it only has one class with its
properties and methods. This is the class ``rectangle``!

Importing dynamically the module
::
	>>> Rectangle = __import__('6-rectangle').Rectangle


Class public attribute testing
=====================================
Testing the public attribute number_of_instances of the class
::
	>>> a = Rectangle(2, 4)
	>>> Rectangle.number_of_instances
	1
	>>> b = Rectangle(7, 4)
	>>> c = Rectangle(2, 6)
	>>> d = Rectangle(1, 3)
	>>> Rectangle.number_of_instances
	4
